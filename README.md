# Casperish

I wanted to change Casper as least as possible, but still make the few changes I wanted.

## Upgrades to Casper to do

* Remove Ghost icon from bottom of screen
* Add linked in icon to social icons on floating post bar.
* Add disqus comments.

Added prism by code injection so that isn't see here.


## Upgrades completed.

**None**, I had time to fork this but haven't had time to update files yet will do that in the next few days.
